## <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download


Free 32-bit version
: The free 32-bit version of kdb+ (for non-commercial use) can be downloaded from [kx.com](https://kx.com/download). Follow the instructions.

Commercial versions
: Commercial versions of kdb+ are distributed to customers from [downloads.kx.com](https://downloads.kx.com). (Credentials for this site are issued to customers’ [Designated Contacts](licensing/#obtaining-a-license-key-file)). 

!!! tip "Internal distribution"
    Most customers download the latest release of kdb+ and make that (along with the accompanying README.txt, the change list) available from a central file server. 

    Encourage your developers frequently to fold the latest release of kdb+ into their development cycle, and match the version used in production. This can greatly simplify development, deployment and debugging.

The names of the downloaded ZIPs denote the platform (`l64.zip` – 64-bit Linux; `w32.zip` – 32-bit Windows, etc.).

!!! warning "Test versions"
    Numerical release versions of the form 2.8, or 3.2 are production code. Versions of kdb+ with a trailing `t` in the name such as `3.3t` are test versions and are neither intended nor supported for production use.


## <i class="fa fa-apple"></i> macOS

If necessary, unzip the archive. A new folder `q` will appear in your Downloads folder.

Next perform the _Minimum install and launch_. We then strongly recommend continuing to [Complete install and launch](#complete-install-and-launch).


### Minimum install and launch

Open the Terminal application (Bash). It will prompt you with its own version of the following:
```bash
Mark:~ sjt$ 
```
Answer the prompts as follows:

![Answer the prompts like this.](img/install_mac_01.png "Answer the prompts like this")

You have installed and launched kdb+.

To exit from kdb+, type `\\`


### Complete install and launch

The minimum installation can be improved in two important ways. We strongly recommend them.

-   Call kdb+ within the `rlwrap` command, which will allow you to call back and edit previous lines
-   Define `q` as a command, allowing you to invoke kdb+ without specifying the path to it


#### Install Rlwrap

Exit kdb+ to return to the Bash prompt and your home folder. Ask for Rlwrap’s version number. If you see one, Rlwrap is already installed

![rlwrap -v](img/install_mac_03.png "rlwrap -v")

If Rlwrap is already installed you can go on to the next step.

Otherwise, you will be told `rlwrap: command not found`. Install Rlwrap using your package manager. (Probably either [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) or [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/))


#### Edit your profile

In Bash, open your profile `~/.bash_profile` with TextEdit (or your favourite text editor)

![open -a Textedit .bash\_profile](img/install_mac_04.png "open -a Textedit .bash_profile")

and append the following line
```bash
alias q='QHOME=~/q rlwrap -r ~/q/m32/q'
```
and save it. Tell Bash to use the revised profile:

![source .bash\_profile](img/install_mac_05.png "source .bash_profile")


### Confirm installation

From your home folder open q, type an expression and recall it using the up-arrow key:

![In q, type an expression and recall it with the up-arrow key](img/install_mac_06.png "In q, type an expression and recall it with the up-arrow key")

You’re done. You have completely installed kdb+. See [what’s next](#whats-next).


## <i class="fa fa-windows"></i> Microsoft Windows

This will put a file `windows.zip` in your Downloads folder. Extract the files to `C:\`, producing a new folder `C:\q`. (You can install on a different filepath. If you do, in the following instructions simply replace `C:\q` with your filepath.)


### Confirm q is working

Open a command shell window: type Windows-r (or click the Start button) and type `cmd`.

Launch q by typing `C:\q\w32\q`. You should see the kdb+ banner, followed by the `q)` prompt. Type `til 6` to see the first 6 integers. Type `\\` to exit q.

![C:32](img/install_windows_01.png "C:32")


### Define q as a command

Defining `q` as a command allows you to invoke kdb+ without specifying the path to it.

In the MS-DOS shell, type
```dos
setx QHOME "C:\q"
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\q\w32"
exit
```
![Setting environment variables](img/install_windows_02.png "Setting environment variables")

This will close your shell session. Open a new shell session and confirm `q` now works as a command.

![Confirm q works as a command](img/install_windows_03.png "Confirm q works as a command")

You’re done. You have completely installed kdb+. See [what’s next](#whats-next).


## <i class="fa fa-linux"></i> Linux

Open a Bash session (eg LXTerminal) in your home folder and `cd` to your Downloads folder. Unzip the archive. A new folder q will appear in your Downloads folder. Copy it to your home folder and `cd` there.

![cd ~/Downloads unzip linux-x86.zip cp -r q ~/. cd ~](img/install_linux_01.png "cd ~/Downloads unzip linux-x86.zip cp -r q ~/. cd ~")

### 32-bit or 64-bit?

Use the `uname` command to determine whether your machine is using the 32-bit or 64-bit Linux distribution.
```bash
uname -m
```
![Determining the distribution bit size](img/install_linux_02.png "Determining the distribution bit size")

If the result is `i686` or `i386` or similar, you are running a **32-bit** distribution. If the results is `x86_64`, you are running a **64-bit** distribution.

If you are installing 32-bit kdb+ on a 32-bit Linux distribution, proceed to [Launch (minimum install)](#minimum-install-and-launch).

But if you are installing 32-bit kdb+ on a 64-bit Linux distribution, you will need a 32-bit library. Use your usual package manager to install i686 or i386: for example:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386
```


### Minimum install and launch

Confirm that kdb+ runs. In your home folder, type:
```bash
q/l32/q
```
![Launching q](img/install_linux_03.png "Launching q")

to see the kdb+ banner and the `q)` prompt. Type `til 6` to see the first six integers. Type `\\` to return to Linux.

You have completed the minimum installation. We recommend proceeding to the _Complete install and launch_.


### Complete install and launch

The minimum installation can be improved in two important ways. We strongly recommend them.

* Call kdb+ within the `rlwrap` command, which will allow you to call back and edit previous lines
* Define `q` as a command, allowing you to invoke kdb+ without specifying the path to it

#### Install Rlwrap

Exit kdb+ to return to the Bash prompt and your home folder. Ask for Rlwrap’s version number. If you see one, Rlwrap is already installed

![Exit q and see if Rlwrap is installed](img/install_linux_04.png "Exit q and see if Rlwrap is installed")

If Rlwrap is already installed you can go on to the next step.

Otherwise, you will be told `rlwrap: command not found`. Install Rlwrap using your package manager.

#### Edit your profile

In the File Manager, find `.bashrc` in your home folder.

![Bash profile](img/install_linux_05.png "Bash profile")

Open it with a text editor and append the following line
```bash
alias q='QHOME=~/q rlwrap -r ~/q/l32/q'
```
and save it. Tell Bash to use the revised profile: `source .bashrc`

![source .bashrc](img/install_linux_06.png "source .bashrc")

### Confirm installation

From your home folder open q, type an expression and recall it using the up-arrow key:

![In q, type an expression and recall it with the up-arrow key](img/install_linux_07.png "In q, type an expression and recall it with the up-arrow key")

You’re done. You have completely installed kdb+. 


## Licences

Usage of the free, non-commercial 32-bit distribution of kdb+ is governed by the terms and conditions on the [download page](https://kx.com/download). 

Commercial distributions of kdb+ require a license file to run. Without it, they signal a license error and abort.

## Installing elsewhere

You can install kdb+ where you please. The environment variable `QHOME` (specified in the instructions above) tells kdb+ where its home folder is.
