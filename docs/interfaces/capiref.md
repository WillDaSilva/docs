## Overview

### K object

The C API provides access to the fundamental data `K` object of kdb+ and methods of manipulating it. The `K` object is a pointer to a `k0` struct, a [tagged union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union), and most of the API manipulates this pointer.

It is defined as
```c
typedef struct k0 *K;
```

More detailed information can be found in C API header file [k.h](https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb/blob/master/c/c/k.h).
The C API defines some types to improve uniformity of the API.

| type          | type letter|
|---------------|---------|
| unsigned char | `G`     |
| 16-bit int    | `H`     |
| 32-bit int    | `I`     |
| 64-bit int    | `J`     |
| 32-bit float  | `E`     |
| 64-bit double | `F`     |
| char          | `C`     |
| char\*        | `S`     |
| void          | `V`     |
| 16-byte array | `U`     |


### Accessing members of the K object

#### K object properties for object x

The members which are common to all variant types are `t`, `u`, and `r`. The field `n` is common to all variant types which have a length. These may be dereferenced as usual in the C language: 

| accessor | description                  |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x->t`   | type of K object. (`signed char`).|
| `x->u`   | attribute. `0` means no attributes. (`C`).|
| `x->r`   | reference count. Modify only via `r1(x),r0(x)`. (`I`) |
| `x->n`   | number of elements in a list. (`J`)|

#### Atom accessors for object x

The fields of the variant types which represent an atom (sometimes called a scalar) are:

| kdb+ type| accessor | derived types                     |
|--------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| byte   | `x->g` (`G`)  | boolean, char                     |
| short  | `x->h` (`H`)  |                                   |
| int    | `x->i` (`I`)  | month, date, minute, second, time |
| long   | `x->j` (`J`)  | timestamp, timespan               |
| real   | `x->e` (`E`)  |                                   |
| float  | `x->f` (`F`)  | datetime                          |
| symbol | `x->s` (`S`)  | error                             |
| table  | `x->k` (`K`)  |                                   |


#### List accessors

To simplify accessing the members for list variant, the following multiple helper macros are provided, to be used as, `kG(x)`, for example.

q type name  | interface list accessor function 
-------------|-----------------------------------------------
mixed list   | `K* kK(x)`
boolean      | `G* kG(x)`
guid         | `U* kU(x)`
byte         | `G* kG(x)`
short        | `H* kH(x)`
int          | `I* kI(x)`
long         | `J* kJ(x)`
real         | `E* kE(x)`
float        | `F* kF(x)`
char         | `C* kC(x)`
symbol       | `S* kS(x)`
timestamp    | `J* kJ(x)`
month        | `I* kI(x)`
date         | `I* kI(x)` (days from 2000.01.01)
datetime     | `F* kF(x)` (days from 2000.01.01)
timespan     | `J* kJ(x)` (nanoseconds) 
minute       | `I* kI(x)`
second       | `I* kI(x)`
time         | `I* kI(x)` (milliseconds)
dictionary   | `kK(x)[0]` for keys and `kK(x)[1]` for values 


## Constants

`q` has a rich type system. The type is indicated by a type number and many of these numbers have a constant defined around 0. Positive numbers are used for types which have a length, and the negative of these represent the scalar type. 
For example, `KB` is the type for a vector of booleans, and the negative, `-KB` is for an atom of type boolean.
Some types do not have a constant. For example, `mixed list` has type `0`, and `error` has a type `-128`.

constant | associated type | value
---------|-----------------|------
KB       | boolean         | 1
UU       | guid            | 2
KG       | byte            | 4  
KH       | short           | 5  
KI       | int             | 6  
KJ       | long            | 7  
KE       | real            | 8  
KF       | float           | 9  
KC       | char            | 10 
KS       | symbol          | 11 
KP       | timestamp       | 12 
KM       | month           | 13

Some numeric constants are defined and have special meaning â€“ indicating null or positive infinity for that type.

## Variables

`es`
: Global `char*`, a pointer to an error string if the last operation returned `NULL`.


## Functions 
Unless otherwise specified, no function accepting `K` objects should be passed `NULL`.


`b9`
: `K b9(I mode,K x)`
: Serialise `x` using q IPC, using `mode` capabilities level, where `mode` is:

    value | effect
    ------|------
    -1    | use within shared libraries from V3.0 onwards
    0     | unenumerate, block serialization of timespan and timestamp (for working with versions prior to V2.6)
    1     | retain enumerations, allow serialization of timespan and timestamp: Useful for passing data between threads
    2     | unenumerate, allow serialization of timespan and timestamp
    3     | unenumerate, compress, allow serialization of timespan and timestamp

: On success, returns byte array K object with serialised representation. On error, `NULL` is returned, and `es` will contain error string.

`d9`
: `K d9(K x)`
: Deserialize the byte array in `x`. 
: The byte array `x` passed to `d9` is not altered in any way. 

: On success, returns deserialized K object. On error, `NULL` is returned, and `es` will contain error string.


`dj`
: `I dj(I date)`
: Convert q date to `yyyymmdd` integer.

`dl`
: `K dl(V* f, I n)`
: The dynamic link. Function takes a C function that would take _n_ K objects as arguments and returns a K object. Shared library only.
: Returns a q function. 

`dot`
: `K dot(K x, K y)`
: The same as the q function `.[x;y]`. Shared library only.

: On success, returns K object with result of `.` application. On error, `NULL` is returned, and `es` will contain error string. See `ee` for result-handling example.


`ee`
: `K ee(K)`
: Helper function to capture (and reset) error string into usual error object, e.g.
: `K x=ee(dot(a,b));if(xt==-128)printf("error %s\n",x->s);`
: Since V3.5 2017.02.16, V3.4 2017.03.13


### Appending to a list

When appending to a list, if the capacity of the list is 
insufficient to accommodate the new data, the list is reallocated with the contents of `x` updated. The new data is always appended.

`ja`
: `K ja(K* x,V*)` 
: Appends a raw value to a list. 
: Returns the value of the contents of `x`.


`jk`
: `K jk(K* x,K y)` 
: Append another K object to a mixed list. Takes ownership of `y`. 
: Returns the value of the contents of `x`.

`js`
: `K js(K* x,S s)` 
: Append an interned string `s` to a symbol list. 
: Returns the value of the contents of `x`.

`jv`
: `K jv(K* x,K y)`
: Append K list `y` to the first of the same type. Takes ownership of `y`.
: Returns the value of the contents of `x`.

`k`
: `K k(I handle,const S s,...)__attribute__((sentinel))`
: Evaluate `s` with optional parameters either locally (shared library only) or remotely. The last argument must be `NULL`.

: Behavior depends on value of `handle`.

    -    `handle>0`, sends sync message to handle, to evaluate a string or function with parameters, and then blocks until a message of any type is received on handle. It can return `NULL` (indicating a network error) or a pointer to a k object. `k(handle,(S)NULL)` does not send a message, and blocks until a message of any type is received on handle.
    If that object has type -128, it indicates an error, accessible as a null-terminated string in `r->s`. When you have finished using this object, it should be freed by calling `r0(r)`.

    -    `handle<0`, this is for async messaging, and the return value can be either 0 (network error) or non-zero (success). This result should _not_ be passed to `r0`.

    -   `handle=0`, this function is equivalent of `dot`.

: See more on [message types](java-client-for-q.md#message-types). Note that `k` call will block until messages is sent/received (`handle!=0`) or evaluated (`handle=0`).

`khpu`

`kclose`
: `V kclose(I)`
: Note that with the release of `c.o` with V2.6, `c.o` now tracks the connection type (pre V2.6, or V2.6+). Hence, to close the connection, you must call `kclose` (instead of `close` or `closeSocket`) â€“ this will clean up the connection tracking and close the socket.
